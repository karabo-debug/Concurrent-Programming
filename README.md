# MultiThreaded Concurrent Club Simulation (Java)

# Overview
The objective is to correct and extend the existing code for a multithreaded Java simulation of patrons in a club. Utilize synchronization mechanisms to ensure that the simulation adheres to specified synchronization constraints and maintains safety and liveness.

# Requirements
Java Development Kit (JDK) (version X.X.X)

# Getting Started
1. Download the project files.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

3. Use the following command to compile and run the Java program:
   'make run'

4. If need be customize the Makefile by changing the arguments under 'Target to run the ClubSimulation class'

5. Re-run the Makefile command to execute the ClubSimulation algorithm.

6. If it happens you modify any of the programs execute 'make clean', then 'make' and then 'make run'
